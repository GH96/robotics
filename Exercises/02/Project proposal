Project proposal:

What:
play a game with a human:
	human puts smth, robot puts smth on top (not fall)
it must be in real-time, as less delays as possible

if RL: how to demonstarate??

How:
Tracking changed pixels, find when no change (oject on the table) to start
inverse kinematics, control - trajectory to reach
OpenCV, with filtering based on color - to find the object

React fast

additional requirement: several objects, which can be put on top
